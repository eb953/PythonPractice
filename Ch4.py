## Loops 

magicians = ['eric', 'max','will', 'parker']
for x in magicians:
    print(x)

## x is the variable - better to use singluar and plural names -> magician in magicians 


magicians = ['eric', 'max','will', 'parker']
for magician in magicians:
    print(f"{magician.title()}, that was a great trick!"
    )
